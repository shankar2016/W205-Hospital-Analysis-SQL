What Hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high 
scores for a variety of procedures


There are two potential approaches to determining the best hospital from this database. 

1). Look at patient survey scores. 
2). Look at Effective Care scores and Readmissions score. This is the chosen approach.

Patient surveys can provide a good view of the hospital and its environment, the interaction of the 
nurses and doctors, staff responsiveness, and other non-medical issues. 

However, Care scores and Re-admissions scores are a true indication of the medical care provided 
by the hospital. The medical care provided is the true measure of a hopital and its staff.  Hence, 
in this work, a composite metric representing the scores of the Effectve Care and the Readmissions 
is used to determine the best hospital. 


The Effective Care score and the Readmissions score are added to create a composite measure and 
the top 10 hospitals are identified. The results show that

	> 450348	FALLS COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND CLINIC	251.283
    	> 400079	HOSP COMUNITARIO BUEN SAMARITANO	184.1
    	> 451330	MEDINA REGIONAL HOSPITAL		151.257
